# TubeletGraph x MOSCATO: CMU S12 sandwich

This branch runs TubeletGraph on the exact CMU-MMAC video represented by the
only matching MOSCATO CMU annotation entry requested for this experiment:

```text
Video / MOSCATO key: S12_Sandwich_7150991-2470
AVI: S12_Sandwich_Video/S12_Sandwich_7150991-2470.avi
Ground truth: annotations/ground_truth/CMU/gt_annotations_cmu.json
Initial target: bread slices
Global clip: [2824, 6714)
Local frame 0: raw/MOSCATO frame 2824
```

The AVI and MOSCATO bundle are local data inputs and are intentionally ignored
by Git. The experiment manifest is
`configs/s12_sandwich_7150991-2470.json`.

## Verified alignment

The source AVI is H.264, 800 x 600, 30 FPS, and 6,714 raw frames. The MOSCATO
`object` array and all five object-state timelines are also 6,714 frames. Never
use `feature_len` (2,239) as the raw frame count.

Run the check again at any time:

```bash
python3 scripts/inspect_video.py
```

## Prepare the one-object clip

Install local tools (FFmpeg must also be on `PATH`):

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements-moscato.txt
```

Decode every raw frame first, then select and zero-base the configured clip:

```bash
python3 scripts/prepare_frames.py
```

This creates:

```text
work/S12_Sandwich_7150991-2470/
├── raw_frames/       # 0000000.jpg ... 0006713.jpg
├── frames/           # local 0 = global 2824
├── first_frame.jpg
└── metadata.json
```

Create the checked-in starting mask geometry:

```bash
python3 scripts/make_mask.py \
  --image work/S12_Sandwich_7150991-2470/frames/0000000.jpg \
  --polygons-json configs/s12_bread_slices_mask.json \
  --out work/S12_Sandwich_7150991-2470/mask.png
```

The result must be an 800 x 600 single-channel PNG containing only values 0
and 1. Visually inspect it before spending GPU time. To redraw it interactively,
omit `--polygons-json`; press `n` to close one polygon and begin another.

## Modal, OpenAI, and W&B environments

TubeletGraph is installed and run only in the CUDA Modal image defined by
`modal_tubelet.py`. The key is never placed in a file or image layer.

One-time setup:

```bash
python3 -m pip install modal
modal setup
modal volume create tubelet-data
modal secret create tubelet-openai OPENAI_API_KEY="$OPENAI_API_KEY"
modal secret create wandb WANDB_API_KEY="$WANDB_API_KEY"
```

The local Python environment is `.venv/`. Runtime credentials are separate
Modal environments: `tubelet-openai` injects `OPENAI_API_KEY` only into the GPU
inference function, while `wandb` injects `WANDB_API_KEY` only into the CPU
evaluation function. Neither key is copied into an image or committed to Git.

Upload the prepared frames and mask:

```bash
modal volume put \
  tubelet-data \
  work/S12_Sandwich_7150991-2470/frames \
  /S12_Sandwich_7150991-2470/frames

modal volume put \
  tubelet-data \
  work/S12_Sandwich_7150991-2470/mask.png \
  /S12_Sandwich_7150991-2470/mask.png

modal volume put \
  tubelet-data \
  vocabulary/CMU/state_dict.json \
  /S12_Sandwich_7150991-2470/state_dict.json

modal volume put \
  tubelet-data \
  annotations/ground_truth/CMU/gt_annotations_cmu.json \
  /S12_Sandwich_7150991-2470/ground_truth.json
```

The ground truth is mounted only by the separate evaluation function. The GPU
inference function never reads it.

First run TubeletGraph's bundled example after the secret exists:

```bash
modal run modal_tubelet.py --smoke-test
```

Only after that succeeds, run S12:

```bash
modal run modal_tubelet.py \
  --video-id S12_Sandwich_7150991-2470 \
  --fps 30
```

The runner verifies CUDA, mask shape/values, and contiguous frame names before
starting. The image pins TubeletGraph commit
`fdb05b6fbd7f4644aea990bf967cc18d82bf291b` and requests Modal's ordered
80 GB-class GPU fallbacks: A100-80GB, H100, then H200. It
persists predictions, raw VLM responses, mapped event JSON, visualizations, a
run log, and a manifest beneath:

```text
/S12_Sandwich_7150991-2470/runs/<run-name>/
```

Use `modal volume ls tubelet-data` to find the run and `modal volume get` to
download it. Do not calculate MOSCATO metrics before visually validating that
the tracked mask stays on the bread.

## Convert and evaluate a validated run

The Modal runner automatically writes `tubelet_events.draft.json` and the
closed-vocabulary `tubelet_events.json` beside the run manifest. The following
commands are the reproducible fallback if the adapter needs to be rerun from a
downloaded raw prediction.

Locate the VLM-enriched prediction JSON under the run's `predictions/` tree and
build a draft that preserves every raw TubeletGraph node:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_event_draft.py \
  --prediction <run>/predictions/custom-S12_Sandwich_7150991-2470-Ours_gpt-4.1/S12_Sandwich_7150991-2470_1.json \
  --out work/S12_Sandwich_7150991-2470/tubelet_events.draft.json
```

The draft deliberately contains null state fields. Run the fixed closed-list
adapter with the OpenAI key supplied as a runtime environment variable (or run
this command inside Modal with the same secret):

```bash
python3 scripts/map_event_states.py \
  --draft work/S12_Sandwich_7150991-2470/tubelet_events.draft.json \
  --state-dict vocabulary/CMU/state_dict.json \
  --frames work/S12_Sandwich_7150991-2470/frames \
  --out work/S12_Sandwich_7150991-2470/tubelet_events.json
```

The adapter sees the frame, TubeletGraph text, and the allowed state names. It
does not load `gt_annotations_cmu.json`. Its raw responses and mapped labels
remain in the output for audit.

Evaluate only after inspecting those mappings:

```bash
python3 scripts/evaluate.py \
  --annotations annotations/ground_truth/CMU/gt_annotations_cmu.json \
  --state-dict vocabulary/CMU/state_dict.json \
  --events work/S12_Sandwich_7150991-2470/tubelet_events.json \
  --out-csv results/S12_Sandwich_7150991-2470/bread_slices.csv
```

For a completed Modal run, calculate the same metrics and publish the final
results, threshold curve, per-frame table, and reproducibility artifact to W&B:

```bash
modal run modal_tubelet.py \
  --evaluate-run-name <validated-run-name> \
  --wandb-project chefost-tubeletgraph-moscato
```

Add `--wandb-entity <team-or-user>` only when the run should be sent to a
specific W&B entity. The command prints the final four scores and W&B run URL,
and saves the evaluation beneath the completed run's `evaluation/` directory
on the `tubelet-data` Volume.

## Evaluation policy

The scripts in this branch use these fixed rules:

- One evaluation unit is one target object at one raw video frame.
- Local frame `i` maps to MOSCATO frame `2824 + i`.
- The initial predicted state propagates to the first transition; transition
  states forward-fill until the next transition.
- A one-state prediction is correct when it is present in MOSCATO's state list.
- Frames whose MOSCATO state list is empty are excluded from adjective metrics.
- TubeletGraph/VLM text must be mapped to the checked-in MOSCATO vocabulary
  without consulting the ground-truth timeline.
- `word_accuracy/accuracy` is exact per-frame state-label hit accuracy.
- `word_accuracy/precision` and `word_accuracy/f1` are micro-averaged over the
  canonical MOSCATO state vocabulary.
- `word_accuracy/f1_max` is the best micro-F1 from global thresholds 0.1 through
  0.9. The current adapter emits one hard state rather than calibrated scores,
  so its one-hot score sweep is reported explicitly and F1-max will ordinarily
  match micro-F1.

The original detailed setup notes are retained in
`tubeletgraph_moscato_cmu_setup.md` as local source material.
